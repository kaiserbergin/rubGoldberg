# Rube Goldberg Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3

## Intended for use with Oculus
Created with focus on Oculus as I don't own a Vive.

## Cool Stuff
- Created particle effects for teleportation markers, walls, ball trails, and fan wind.  Wind uses default particles, but the teleportation markers and trails on the boundaries were created by me using aseprite
- Added additional cameras which are viewable on the left controller's menu that help you see where your ball is traveling through the level
- Each level provides the required items to successfully complete the level
- Teleporter modified to detect collision with platforms and set the teleportation location to top of platform
- Teleporter modified to detect collision with level boundaries and set tp location on the floor below the boundary

A lot of the development was done during streams which can be viewed at: https://www.twitch.tv/kaiserbergin/videos/all - but there's like 18 hours of footage, and I still left out a few sessions.  So maybe... don't watch them, just appreciate that they exist.
